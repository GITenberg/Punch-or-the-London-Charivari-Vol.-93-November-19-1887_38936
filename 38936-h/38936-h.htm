</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span>,</p>


<p>I daresay you will have been expecting for some time to hear from me,
and it is quite true I owe you a letter. But the fact is, I'm sick of
letter-writing, which, always a bore, has of late been invested with
fresh terrors. The way I am being used up by our Conservative friends is
perhaps a little audacious. It certainly is quite embarrassing. Whenever
any of their men get into a tight place, or embark upon a difficult
enterprise, they write to me for a character, quite regardless of my
personal predilections, and even of my actual pledges. You will have
seen a good deal of this, including the latest production touching the
Aberdeen University Election, where <span class="smcap">G-sch-n</span> hopes to ride in on
my back.</p>

<p>But that was nothing to the letter they got me to write about the
Glasgow University Rectorship. That was, unhappily, not my first
production on the subject. Months ago I was asked what I thought of
<span class="smcap">R-s-b-ry</span> as Rector, and I let them have my opinion straight. A
better fellow, take him all round, there isn't in either House. Just the
man to be Lord Rector of a Scotch University, if he cares to undertake
the office. Since then, however, <span class="smcap">L-tt-n</span> comes along, and with
that stupendous ambition for personal distinction which I don't
understand, not satisfied with being Ambassador to Paris, wants to be
Lord Rector of Glasgow University. Of course they come to me to back him
up,&mdash;a peculiarly hot corner to put a fellow in. It happens not only
that I have published my opinion about <span class="smcap">R-s-b-ry</span>, but all the
world knows what I think of <span class="smcap">L-tt-n</span>. Still, as the M-rk-ss says,
we must keep out <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> from Downing Street; and so we'll
put in <span class="smcap">L-tt-n</span> for Glasgow University. A hard pill to swallow,
but I gulped at it, and the letter was written. But between you and me,
<span class="smcap">Toby</span>, I felt nearer being mean than I ever did in my life, and
would go a long way round rather than look a Glasgow University lad in
the face.</p>

<p>Still, it is no new experience for me to be persuaded to do things I
don't like. I'm swallowing hard pills in the Conservative interest now,
but many a box I've cleared out in former days to make things pleasant
for <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span>. You've seen me, I daresay, reluctantly brought
up to the box on the table of the House, patted, pushed, placed in
position, and made to support all kinds of things, which a few months or
weeks earlier I honestly believe I loathed. As I write I see
<span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> nodding encouragingly as I proceed. I hear the
rapturous cheers of the Radicals, delighted to find me won over. I am
conscious of the chilling silence on the benches immediately behind, and
I am roused to more desperate declaration by the satirical cheers of my
friends on the benches opposite. I recall, as it were but yesterday, the
effect <span class="smcap">H-rc-rt's</span> cheer used to have upon me&mdash;the strong
temptation to turn round, publicly chuck up the whole business, and go
back to the expression of my opinion on the particular topic before
<span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> took me in hand.</p>

<p>That's all over now, at least in that particular development. But it's
the same old thing over again in altered circumstances.</p>

<p>After I had consented to support <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne's</span> last Land Bill, he
sent me a gushing letter, in which he said that, turning over the pages
of <span class="smcap">T-rt-ll-n</span>, he had come upon a passage which might well be
engraved on my tombstone. I thought at the time it was, in chronological
circumstances, rather cool his preparing a tombstone for me. But that by
the way. Here is the epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Sic vita erat; facile omnes perferre ac pati;</p>
<p>Cum quibus erat cunque una, his sese dedere;</p>
<p>Eorum obsequi studiis; adversus nemini,</p>
<p>Nunquam pr&aelig;ponens se aliis.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p>But that was, of course, before I bolted on the Home-Rule question. I
fancy he has found another passage since.</p>

<p>I know I'm not a person of any conspicuous ability. If I had not been
born a <span class="smcap">C-v-nd-sh</span> I would never have been even a
<span class="smcap">Ch-pl-n</span>. But as things fell out, I am like the boy in the
middle of the balanced plank, at the end of which two others sit.
According as I move to the right or to the left, one end of the plank
goes up, and the other down. So the friends on either side constantly
shoulder me one way or the other; which is all very well for them, but
rather a nuisance to me.</p>

<p>It is part of this perpetual little game by which I am used for the
convenience of others, that you get all the talk about my being Premier.
I am not at all sure that I should not be shouldered into <i>that</i>
by-and-by, if it were not for <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>. I do not pretend to
see further through a ladder than an ordinary passer-by; but it is clear
to me that you can never have a Government rival to the regular Liberals
(observe, I do not say a Conservative Government) without
<span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>. It is no secret that I have never hankered after
<span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>, neither liking him, nor believing in him. You know
what Dr. <span class="smcap">J-hns-n</span> said about <span class="smcap">C-ll-y C-bb-r</span>. I don't
exactly, but it was something to the effect that "as for
<span class="smcap">Cibber</span>, if you take away from his conversation all that he
should not have said, he is a poor creature." That is a way of putting
it curiously applicable to <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span>. If you take away from his
political speeches all that he should not have said, he is a poor
creature, a presumptuous rattle-trap, the <i>gamin</i> of Conservative
politics. But if I undertake the titular headship of the Conservative
Party, I shall have to deal with him, and that, as they say in a
circular space of which I now see too little, is not good enough.</p>

<p>That is my present opinion. But, bless us all! I may be talked round on
this point, and used by a Party as I was when I made my first appearance
in the House of Commons nearly thirty years ago, and, a mere stripling,
was made the instrument of turning out a powerful Government.
<span class="author">Yours dejectedly,</span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The plane's broad plates of weather-beaten gold</p>
  <p class="i2">Lie shrunk and sodden in the miry way,</p>
  <p class="i2">Never around the dappled trunk to play</p>
<p>Again with tricksy beams, and breezes bold.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Night swathes the sober light in thickening fold,</p>
  <p class="i2">Like a grey moth, webb'd in a prison grey,</p>
  <p class="i2">And the wan willow to the dying day</p>
<p>Gleams like despair, unsolaced and untold.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now from the village tow'r the bells begin</p>
  <p class="i2">Their sad-soul'd chiming, as a sullen boy</p>
<p>Wails on in wantonness. Oh, to greet again</p>
  <p class="i2">Thames's bright Strand, his theatre-studded joy,</p>
<p>The postman's frequent rap, the newsboy's din,</p>
<p>The constant cab, the ever-circling train.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="smcap">In the So-called Nineteenth Century.</span>"&mdash;When giving three
Bishops a little touching up in Mr. <span class="smcap">Kkowles's</span>
<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, why does the playful Professor always write
"<i>&agrave; priori</i>" instead of "<i>a priori?</i>" As no one would accuse
Mr. <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> of falling into a "clerical error," the explanation
must be that he had nothing to do with it, or didn't know any better, or
his printer would have it so, or the Printer's Devil possessed him, or
Bathybius got loose and played the mischief with the type. Perhaps it is
we who are wrong, if so, we ask has it anything to do with the new
accent which is to be used in the pronunciation of Latin? A trifling
matter&mdash;but for a Professor so "acute" such an accent may be considered
a "grave" mistake.</p>

<p>But now, as to bait? Well, ahem!&mdash;yes, I fear,</p>
<p>The Gladstonian minnow is popular here,&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i4">It's a bait I abominate wholly.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;if I fish as I fancy&mdash;I feel</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Ha! ha! Yes, I have it. I've made up a bait</p>

    <p class="i4">Yes, this, I am certain, must fix 'em.</p>

<p>It is&mdash;and it isn't&mdash;the very same bait</p>
<p>That the Nottingham fellows&mdash;as anglers so great&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i4">Consider the pink of perfection.</p>
<p>Why, <span class="smcap">William</span> himself might well capture a dish</p>
<p>With this bait; did he use it, I'm sure, not a fish</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the <i>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus</i> is to be produced at
Cambridge. One of the members of the A. D. C. wanted to bring out an old
burlesque on <i>&OElig;dipus</i> at the Club Theatre on the same night, but
Mr. J. W. <span class="smcap">Clarke</span> of Trinity, General Manager and University
Entrepreneur, immediately objected that it would be irreverent to turn
the awful story of <i>&OElig;dipus</i> and <i>Jocasta</i> into a jest,

<p>O Doctor <span class="smcap">Milner Fothergill</span>, it's hard to hear you state,</p>
<p>That people who must dwell in towns will all deteriorate;</p>

<p>And, like the Ichthyosaurus, we develop too much acid.</p>

<p><i>The Arabian Nights</i>, at the Globe, is a piece chiefly remarkable
for the performances of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span> and <span class="smcap">Penley</span>,
and Miss <span class="smcap">Lottie Venne</span>. The play is an adaptation from the
German. It has been "done into English" at least once before, when,
under the joint authorship of a lady and gentleman, a version was
produced with the very appropriate title of <i>The Skeleton</i>. The
Comedy in Newcastle Street, Strand, is more than a framework, for it has
sinews, and resembles, to some extent flesh and blood. Miss <span class="smcap">Lottie
Venne</span> has not been seen to so much advantage since she embodied
<i>Betsy</i> at the Criterion; and Mr. <span class="smcap">Penley</span>, in his get-up,
suggests that he has not altogether forgotten a character he played
years ago in <i>Our Club</i>. The part now taken by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span>
was, I believe, originally intended for Mr. <span class="smcap">Wyndham</span>. The plot
is of the usual character. A married man, in the absence of his wife,
gets involved in a more or less innocent flirtation with some one else,
and, to escape from this entanglement, on the return of his better half,
has to trust to his power of invention as a substitute for a plain
statement of facts. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span>, as the embarrassed husband,
was guilty of verbal equivocation (to use a pleasant substitute for
"lying") with an earnestness that insured success. This is very like
somebody's piece called <i>Truth</i> at the Criterion. <i>The Arabian
Nights</i> is a kind of piece that will be the better for "working up,"
and indeed it is a joke which will be improved by repetition. Some of
the lines are so daring, that only a male <span class="smcap">Grundy</span> could have
written them. If the well-known lady of the same name had heard them, I
fancy they would have been erased by request. On the first night,
however, all went well, and I can only trust that every succeeding
audience will be equally appreciative, and not more exacting.</p>

<p>I frankly admit that the Royal Westminster Aquarium has a terrible
fascination for me. It is not the fact that years ago it was opened by
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, as a tribute to the memory of the late
lamented Prince <span class="smcap">Consort</span>, that attracts me, nor do I think that
the recollection that the Survivors of the Balaclava Charge take their
annual dinner in commemoration of the battle of the 25th of October on
the second-floor back favourably impresses me&mdash;no, I imagine that I am
drawn towards it by the posters. Certainly the hoardings persuaded me to
see <i>La Belle Fatma</i> and to assist at a <i>s&eacute;ance</i> with the
Wolves. The other evening I was lured within its highly illuminated
walls by the announcement that those who were present in the stalls in
front of the Central Stage at ten o'clock would see a Shaving Contest.
Two barbers were to shave a number of members of the public for the
stakes of &pound;50 or &pound;100 (I forget which) a side. I arrived in good time
and was told (I fancied rather contemptuously) that the contest was to
come off in "the Balloon Room." I made my way to this mysterious
apartment, which proved to be a hall decorated with charts and maps and
not too brilliantly lighted by one gas-jet. A small man, assisted by a
smaller, stood in front of several chairs, behind which were ranged
toilet necessaries. A mildly-spoken gentleman in evening dress and a
neck scarf then addressed the audience (chiefly composed of persons in
pot hats), and told them (so I understood him to say) that "the
Management" had considered it better to have the entertainment in the
Balloon Room instead of the Central Stage as more appropriate. He then
was loud in his admiration of a patent American razor, which was passed
from hand to hand for inspection amongst the audience. After a while
some youths were induced to come up to be shaved, and were shaved by the
small barber whose eyes had been covered with a bandage before the
commencement of the operation. When the first youth was "done," the
mildly-spoken gentleman observed that he had great pleasure in
announcing that the gentleman had been shaved by Mr. So-and-so, (I
forget the barber's name) blindfolded, without having been cut! This
encouraging information was received with cheers, but I could not help
fancying that the audience was not subsequently quite so eager to assist
by submission to the razor in contributing to the blindfolded barber's
triumph. Then the mildly-spoken gentleman announced that the contest
would not come off, for some reason that was not quite clear to me.
Hereupon a rather aggressive person claimed to be shaved&mdash;and shaved he
was, also another person of an older growth than the first applicants.
The aggressive person turned upon his co-shavist (if I may be allowed to
coin a word) and feeling his chin declared him to be only half shaved.
Then several other persons felt the man's chin and expressed the same
opinion. Then there was a "scene," which I understood the mildly-spoken
gentleman to declare to be "an unseemly altercation," and officers of
the institution in uniform were introduced. The aggressive person
continued his aggressiveness, and claimed to be the Champion Shaver of a
large territory including (I think) both the inhabited and uninhabited
portions of the globe. Then a gentleman in morning dress, connected with
the Management appeared, and we were all requested politely to leave. I
followed with the crowd, for I had an idea (no doubt it was a foolish
fancy) that if I had not I should have been "chucked out." I spent the
rest of the evening in admiring a lady who claimed to be one of the
strongest women, if not the very strongest woman in the world, and
wondering why, before having a cannon fired off, from the support of her
shoulder, she should think it necessary to wave the British flag and
appear in the costume of <span class="smcap">Britannia</span>.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor's Procession was also a "Show," and a very important Show
of the week. It has been so fully described that it requires only a
passing notice. The cars on their return were more pleasing than on
their first appearance, for when seen with the horses' heads turned
westwards the poor creatures, engaged to grace our London holiday, were
shivering in the heavy downpour. Even Father Thames (who should have
been in his element) seemed dissatisfied. When dismissed at the Royal
Courts, and told they might make the best of their way home, the
thinly-clad representatives of Music, Prosperity, and Commerce, were
allowed to assume shawls and wraps, and other protections from the
weather. Why before starting were they not all supplied with umbrellas?
It is true that <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> would have looked a little
incongruous with a <i>parapluie</i>.&mdash;I put this in French in honour of
the Brave Beige Mi Lor <span class="smcap">de Keyser</span>,&mdash;but, on the other hand, she
did not seem <i>much</i> like England without one. The Show was like all
its predecessors, inasmuch as it served once more as an excuse for a
subsequent luncheon party in pleasant company, and again afforded the
populace a glimpse of the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> and Corporation in their
not very frequently assumed characters of the wealthy Unemployed.</p>

he should apply to the Chief Commissioner of Police for a <i>passe-partout</i>,

who is every inch a soldier&mdash;round the waist included&mdash;to be

<p><i>Monarchs I Have Met</i>, by <span class="smcap">Beatty Kingston</span> (<span class="smcap">Chapman &amp;
Hall</span>), is a title which recalls the old story in <span class="smcap">Smith's</span>
<i>Irish Diamonds</i>, and reproduced in another form by <span class="smcap">Charles
Lever</span>, of the little crossing-sweeper who ran home to his mother
and recounted how he had met <span class="smcap">William the Fourth</span>. "Mother, sure
I've met the King this mornin'! An' he spoke to me!!" "Did he now? Bless
his Majesty! An' what might the King have said to yez, <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>?"
"What did he say to me, is it? Sure, he said, 'Get out of the way, ye
dirty little blackguard!'" Not that the Monarchs were so rude to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Beatty Kingston</span>, whose entertaining society was rather thrust
on the Monarchs by his employers than sought by the Royal Personages
themselves. If Mr. <span class="smcap">Kingston</span> was entertaining in one sense, so
were the Monarchs in another. The first volume is especially festive.
Within the first 183 pages there is more eating and drinking than in any
other book I can call to mind since <i>Pickwick</i>. These pages must be
not only read, but well digested. The writer congratulates himself on
"not having let anything escape him;" and certainly nothing eatable or
drinkable seems to have done so. He seems to be always smacking his lips
over reminiscences of the savory and the succulent&mdash;"Savory and More"
should be his motto&mdash;and it is sad to record that apparently&mdash;but I
trust I am mistaken in my deduction&mdash;he glories in iced champagne, which
is rank heresy, and an abomination to the true epicure. His stories are
told in an amusing, rough-and-ready, barrack-like,
swaggery-Germany-soldiery style; and <i>rien n'est sacr&eacute; pour un
sapeur</i>. He witnesses the ceremony of anointing the King of Hungary,
and describes the function as the Primate "oiling" his Majesty, as if
the latter were having his locks Macassar'd, and the Archbishop were the
hair-dresser. Mr. <span class="smcap">Beatty Kingston</span>, according to the Book of B.
K., or "the B. of B. K.," seems to have been generally entertained in
the "most sumptuous manner" wherever he went in Germany and Hungary&mdash;he
is very German, and always very Hung'ry&mdash;and writes of his sojourn in
these countries with a full heart. Then, in the second volume, he finds
himself in Rome, where there was "nothing fit to eat," "food bad,"
"cookery abominable, and the wine worst of all." If the perusal of the
first part of the B. of B. K. causes many a mouth to water, his wretched
plight in the second will draw tears from the eyes of the least
sympathetic. He complains,&mdash;indeed, it is his first and most important
grievance,&mdash;"<i>Imprimis</i>, there was not a bit of clear ice to be had
in the Eternal City. Whatever liquid was cooled at all had to be
inserted in salt snow." What a cruel hardship for any man to bear,
especially a rollicking epicure who revels in "Roederer <i>carte
blanche</i> of Alpine coldness." However, there was a good deal for him
to swallow in Rome, and for lack of better food, he seems to have taken
it in with all the alacrity of a dutiful Special with an appetite for
gossip. The book finishes with less solid eating, but there is smoking
perfumed golden tobacco, preserve-tasting, hot coffee drinking, an
interesting account of <span class="smcap">Lesseps</span>, and also of Prince
<span class="smcap">Michael</span> of Servia. Altogether, these are the volumes of a
Voluble Voyager, containing the amusing tales of a Talkative Traveller,
who can run on by the hour, with no one on the spot to interrupt or
contradict him.</p>

<p>I received, some time since, a charming little book, daintily bound in
vellum, called <i>The Joyous Neighbourhood of Covent Garden</i>, for
which I have to thank Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Eyre Pascoe</span>. It is styled "a
literary souvenir," and, I fancy, is not intended for publication. It
was brought out early this year, but at the time of its first appearance
I did not see it. If still unpublished, it is to be hoped that it will
not remain so for long. His account of <span class="smcap">Evans's</span> in the days of
<span class="smcap">Paddy Green</span> must revive in not a few of us whose memory is
still "green," the reminiscences of many a cheery evening, though Mr.
<span class="smcap">Pascoe</span> seems only to have visited <span class="smcap">Evans's</span> when it was
enlarged, and not in the good stuffy old days, when <span class="smcap">Paddy Green</span>
himself took the chair. The author says that Mr. <span class="smcap">John Green</span> was
"the personification of a stout, cheery, open-hearted, kindly English
landlord." Not "English, you know"&mdash;<span class="smcap">"Paddy" Green</span> could not
well be that, though he might, I admit, "personify" the character.
Anyone wishing to learn as much as he can possibly carry away with him
at a sitting should get Mr. <span class="smcap">Pascoe's</span> book, and if it is not
published, I only wish he may get it.</p>

<p>In the <i>Dublin Review</i> (<span class="smcap">Burns and Oates</span>) for this quarter,
there is a most interesting review of the various Jewish and anti-Jewish
books, which within the last two years have made a considerable stir on
the Continent, especially in France. The Ancient Hebrew Race are, it
appears, to possess the earth,&mdash;ultimately. In all persons with a spark
of genius, nay even with only a talent for music, for drama, for any art
whatsoever, there is&mdash;nay, say some enthusiastic Judaizers, there must
be&mdash;Jewish blood. Most Christians will be inclined to grant the
artfulness of the race, traditionally. The Jews claim every great
Genius. At this, <i>Mr. Punch</i> will put his finger to his nose, and
meditate whether he too has not his share in the <i>damnosey
h&aelig;reditas</i>. A footnote to the article quotes <span class="smcap">G. de Pascal</span> as
stating that, "<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> proposed to sell Ireland to the Jews
for 2,000,000 sterling a year." Then why didn't he do it? Because the
Jews wouldn't buy it, I suppose. If they had, at this present time the
English Government would have been dealing with the
<span class="smcap">O'Rothschilds</span>, the <span class="smcap">O'Levys</span>, and so forth, and on the
National flag, the Harp of Erin would have become the Jews' Harp. That
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> was a Jew, and that his real name was
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, is a theory which the notes of the new edition of
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, now being brought out by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Henry
Irving</span> and <span class="smcap">Frank Marshall</span>, will probably go some way
towards establishing.</p>

<p>I've read, for I <i>can</i> read, you know, of the wild old apprentices' days,</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON LORD MAYOR'S DAY.</h2>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">

<a href="images/illus237.png"><img src="images/illus237.png" width="100%" alt="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p>Determined to have a good long gaze at what I was told was to be a
reglar stunning Lord Mayor's Show, such as they has in sum of the low
countrys of Urope on werry high occasions, I got a old friend of mine,
who's a reglar tribble Bob Major of a bell ringer at a Citty Church, to
git me a ticket for a lovely seat in his boarded Church Yard, oppersite
Newgate, and near the Hold Bayley, so there was plenty to cheer us hup
afore the Show cum, and plenty to emuse us. Of course the best fun of
all was to watch the poore chaps in the crowd below us a being scrowged
and shoved and pushed about, while we sat in our bootiful crimson seats
just like so many hemenent swells in the theatre, a looking down on the
common fellers beneath 'em.</p>

<p>I don't think, upon the hole, if I had my choice, that I woud choose to
be a Perliceman on Lord Mare's Day. Ony to think of the diffrence
betwixt them and hus! They begins hurly, we begins late; they is,
aperiently, on their poor feet all day long, we merely spends a hour or
two in the hevening on them useful xtremes; they has to snatch a bit of
quite plane food and drink anyhows and anywheres, while we&mdash;but no! I
draws a whale over the thrilling contrast; there's sum things as is best
left to the emadgination, speshally such things as them things. And when
at length they seeks their tired homes, what has they to console 'em for
their long day's pushing and scrowging? Nothink! What have we, for our
day of ministering to the luxyourious wants of the helegant and refined?
Sumthink, but how much, depends upon suckemstances over which
unfortnitly we haven't not no control. And I thinks that upon the hole,
the libberality of mankind is not a increesing helement, more's the
pitty!</p>

<p>What a percession it was when at full length it came at last! It begun
with the flags and the principle officers of no less than 8 City
Washupfool Companies. And which of the Officers was it as first fixt my
gaze, and held it firmly? Need I say it was the Beedles in their butiful
Clokes of office. There was a quiet dignerty, not to say a degree of
subblimmity in their demeener, as quite affected me, and I at once
confess, amost arowsed my henvy. Wat a termination to my great career!
But keep quiet my throbbing buzzom, and pass on. Of the four bootiful
Cars drawn by 6 strong horses, I gives my wote without no hezitation to
the Epping Forest one. It was xactly like life, specially the gents a
pretending to carry partridges on their fistes, which was all probbubly
washed off by the rain.</p>

<p>The late Lord Mare was in werry good time, and passed by amid our
shouts, looking jest as good-tempered as he did last year, when he was
our Rising Son of power. At last came the Ero of the day in his grand
old Coach of State, and then came one of the principle ewents of the
journey, for the Carridge and all its six horses was stopt, and about
harf-a-dozzen most respectabel looking gents, all of whom I was told was
Churchwardens and Owerseers of the werry hiest quality, all drest in
their werry best close, and wearing butiful reel gold Badgers, went bang
up to the State Coach and sed something werry kind to the <span class="smcap">Lord
Mare</span>, and gave him something for hisself, at which he seemed werry
much pleased, and said sumthink werry nice in reply, and then we all
cheered so artily that the 6 horses got impashent and insisted on going
on. So on they went, and I seed 'em no more.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of grumbling about the rain, and it suttenly
<i>did</i> rain. I did try to pass it off as a mere passing shower, but
that didn't do after about two hours of it. Sum of the wet higneramusses
wanted to make out as it was all the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare's</span> fault. Well, I
wasn't a-going for to stand that gross injustice while I was comfortably
a setting in my rheumantic churchyard, so I boldly said as how as all
the derangements for the weather was always left to the Hed Waiter, and
that after giving my whole mind to the subject, I had decided that, of
the two, rain and peace and quietness was far more better than sunshine
and row, at which they all larfed, but it put a stop to all the
grumbling, so I reckoned that was one to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most saddest specktacle as was seen by any one pare of eyes
on that orful wet day, was the poor gennelmen of the Lord Mare's
ousehold a picking their dellicate way through the middle of the muddy
road with their butiful wands of office, and striving in wain to keep
their lovely pink silk stockings from being soiled by the wulger mud.
What their feelings must have been how few can no, specially when they
found theirselves the sport of the ribbald jester. I didn't think as the
frantic efforts of the hundereds of children to sing "<i>Rool
Britannier</i>" was werry much helped by the accumpanyment of the
passing Band playing werry lowdly, "<i>All Werry Fine and Large</i>;"
but then, in coarse, tastes differ.</p>

<p>The Bankwet was werry much as usual; that is to say, about the werry
grandest thing in the world; but I cannot report the speeches, coz we
was all on us all turned out of the All directly as they begun, more's
the pitty, but I was priviliged to hear some of the shouting and
hollering.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure whether it's right even of Committee Gentlemen to
make fun of one of the werry sacredest of human hinstitootions, wiz.,
the nessessery refreshment of the xhausted body, and yet I heard one on
'em say to a reel fine tall Cabbinet Minister, who arsked him the werry
nateral question, whether they had their dinner afore or after the
gestes? "Both, and a little snack after breakfast, and a quite lite
supper when it was all over." Praps the xaggeration wasn't werry great,
but still there was xaggeration, and xaggeration is the Waiter's cuss!</p>

<p>It rained as I went to my reserwed place in the frendly church-yard, it
rained as I went to the Bankwetting All, and it rained as I sort my
nupshal couch at about one o'clock, Hay. Hem., and it recalled to fond
memory the words of the Royal Hanthem, "Long to rain over us!"

</div>

<hr />

<h2>NEGATIVE RESULTS.</h2>

<p class="center">[<i>From the Diary of an Irish Instantaneous Photographic Detective.</i></p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Arrived in Dublin. Consider the first thing to do is to
get the goodwill of the Authorities. Make for the Castle. Stopped by a
Sentinel. Focus him in two positions, and rush past him before he has
time to recover himself. Hurry along corridors, and through passages and
ante-chambers, knocking over domestics and Equerry, and two Private
Secretaries, and finally burst in upon the Viceroy. Find him at
breakfast. Instantly focus him. Take him in the act of putting a piece
of hot kidney in his mouth, while Lady <span class="smcap">Londonderry</span> stands in
the background pouring out a cup of tea. He shifts his position, puts
down his knife and fork, and stares at me in mute surprise. Lady
<span class="smcap">Londonderry</span> also pauses with the teapot, and regards me with
astonishment. The pose is graceful. I at once focus them again. A couple
of lovely pictures! They seem even more astonished. Explain my mission,
and say that I thought it as well to look in at the "Castle," and see
that "things were going on all right." They ring the bell, and give me
into custody. Manage, however, to convey to the people at the Police
Station that, acting on a suggestion made by Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Mallock</span>
in a letter to the <i>Times</i>, I had come over in the interests of the
Government, and didn't think there was any harm in introducing myself
familiarly at head-quarters. Add that I think <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> knows
what I'm up to. This seems to influence them. Am let out with a caution.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Determine next to look up the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and
see how he is getting on. Make for his official residence, hurry
upstairs, and present myself. By way of introduction, say I've already
been to the "Castle." Jumps up at this, and shouting out "the divil ye
have!" seizes the poker and makes for me. I whip out my camera and focus
him. Succeed in taking him in five positions. (1) Yelling at me and
jumping over a chair. (2) Throwing an inkstand at my head. (3) Tumbling
over a table in pursuit. (4) Bounding out after me on to the landing.
(5) Kicking me downstairs. Capital pictures, all of them. Fancy they'll
come out well. Escape with my life.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Hear there's to be a popular meeting at Ballymoonin.
Take the train there at once. Find the place crowded. Platform opposite
the Town Hall, with speakers on it. Capital subject. Proceed to take an
instantaneous photograph, when somebody cries out, "Begorra! shure he's
a spy!" Am assailed with a shower of brickbats. Focus several of them.
Hit over the head. Appeal to Mounted Policeman. His only reply is to
back his horse on to me. Horse plunges and kicks out at my camera.
Manage with a little man&oelig;uvring to take a fine picture of his hoofs.
Riot begins. Am pelted out of Ballymoonin, and rush to station taking
occasional instantaneous photographs of rabid pursuers as I fly.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Attend a proclaimed meeting of the Land League at
Kilhoolish. Manage to get inside room, and focus the Chairman, when
somebody asks me what's my "business there at all." Explain that I've
just come to take an instantaneous photograph of the proceedings, in a
friendly way. Chairman takes off his coat, and jumps on to the table.
Focus him again. Shouts out to me, "Is it a frind ye call yerself? Thin,
bedad, me boy, it's jist out of the window we'll put ye."
A rush is made at me. Seize camera, and hurriedly take pictures of
scuffle in seventeen positions. Am ultimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">pg 239</a></span>
hurled out of window. Camera thrown after me Never mind. Have secured
several excellent pictures of legs, arms, flying chairs, and
shillelaghs. Limp off as fast as I can, to develop them.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Turn up at Glencreagh to witness an eviction on Lord
<span class="smcap">Dollibannin's</span> property. One hundred and fifty Police and two
squadrons of Cavalry engaged in supporting Bailiffs. Farm vigorously
defended by infuriated natives. Propose to take an instantaneous
photograph of interior of premises. Approach window with camera. Am
instantly covered with boiling meal, and felled by a crowbar. Endeavour
to focus my assailant. Pursues me to garden-gate. Turn on him with
camera. Sends me flying over the wall. Pull myself together, and creep
off, not altogether disappointed. Find I have succeeded in taking a very
fair negative of a pitchfork.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Make for Tullamore, meaning to finish up with an
instantaneous photograph of <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>. Call on Governor of Gaol
and explain that I should like to take his prisoner, "clothes and all,
just as he is, having a meal, if possible, so as to satisfy the outside
public as to his general condition and appearance." Bids me mind my own
business, and endeavours to slam the door in my face. Tell him I shall
certainly photograph <i>his</i> attitude in the matter. Focus him. Makes
a rush at me, kicks me into the street, and smashes my camera. So can't
even take the sole of his boot. Pity. It would have made a pleasing and
striking picture. However, on the whole, not a bad week's work. But must
rest now for repairs. Am looking forward with confidence to next.</p>

<h2>THE SHRIMP CURE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Pegwell Bey.</i>)</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">
<a href="images/illus240a.png"><img src="images/illus240a.png" width="100%" alt="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My title is Oriental; but I am a British subject. I
address you as an expert. This is the time of Cures&mdash;you have the Grape
Cure, the Whey Cure, the Water Cure, the Bath Cures, the Cures by German
waters&mdash;another and a shorter Whey Cure&mdash;and the Cure by French
watering-places. You have the Homburg Cure, the
Wiesbaden Cure, the Royat Cure; indeed, every kind of Cure, except the
only Perfect Cure, which I assert to be the "Shrimp Cure!"</p>

<p>I know that the pages of <i>Punch</i> are read by all, and, for the
benefit of all mankind, I give these notes from my note-book, which is
that of a physician who has had great experience all over the world, and
especially in the East End of Europe, in order that rich and poor,
prince and peasant, may read, and happily find that true balsam, which
will so far purge his complaints, that he may become whole and well, and
a comfort to his family circle, and the pride of his country. Yes, Sir,
come to <span class="smcap">Pegwell Bey</span> for a cure, and P. B. exclaims, "In the
name of the Profit! Shrimps!"</p>

<p>A few explanatory words about my installation in the locality. I wanted
a Sanatorium. An unfinished row of villas about a mile-and-a-half
distant that had long been on the hands of a local speculative builder
struck me as the very thing. I took the whole terrace forthwith,
speedily instituted a bathing machine fitted up as an ambulance to meet
the down-train, and here I am in three months literally turning patients
away. I may as well add that to enable me to procure a fresh and
constant supply of shrimps for the necessities of my establishment, I
have managed to secure the services of a Retired Smuggler, who says he
knows the coast, and thinks with a lawn tennis net cut up into pieces,
and the assistance of one or two donkey-boys, or even patients, he can
undertake to keep me supplied. But to revert to my experiences.</p>

<p>No. 1. I commence with one of my first cases. I wish to be truthful. It
was not a successful one at first. A. B., &aelig;t. 45, of nervo-bilious
temperament, complained that his nights were fearful; no sleep, pains
everywhere, an uneasy sensation as of billiard-balls being poured down
his back, a horror of society, and distaste for pastry. I had him placed
in the establishment, and began by giving him three pints of shrimps
every four hours. For the first twenty-four hours he improved
wonderfully, he increased in weight and strength, and his appetite was
greater&mdash;no other food than shrimps is allowed; but on the second day I
found him with a temperature of 205&deg; Fahrenheit, a pulse of 270,
respirations 76 in the minute, and in fact in a critical state. I
remained with the patient, I sent for my electric lamp and other
instruments. I made an examination&mdash;a careful scientific
examination&mdash;and I found that he had eaten the <i>heads</i> and
<i>tails</i>. What was to be done? I called in the Retired Smuggler, and
asked his advice. He immediately suggested warm greengage jam. After
many anxious hours, this had the effect of completely soothing the
system, and my patient breathed again. What relief! Having learnt by
experience, I sat with that patient days and days, saw each shrimp
carefully peeled and dipped in weak solution of carbolic acid&mdash;the
result was wonderful. All his hair came off, he looked twenty years
older, and completely lost the use of his legs, but he is now able to
pursue the laborious occupation of an Art Critic with pleasure to
himself and gratification and edification to his numerous readers.</p>

<p>No. 2. The case of a woman in an active stage of consumption is also
remarkable. She consumed everything, from a periwinkle to a Perigord
pie. In other respects appetite normal. Received her into the
establishment&mdash;fed her on shrimp-sauce, in quart pots. She came back
like the rebound of a watch-spring. She only remained three days&mdash;said
she was quite well, and suddenly left, unfortunately without giving her
address, and so her account remains unpaid. I do not think she will
return. The Retired Smuggler is of the same opinion.</p>

<p>No. 3. My next case presents singular features of interest. My patient
in this instance was an aged Duke, whose symptoms were unique and
peculiar. He had deafening noises in his head, like the explosion of
heavy foot artillery, coupled with a continual sensation of descending
rapidly, as in a diving-bell out of order, accompanied by sudden and
unexpected seizures in the spine, as if he were violently run into in
the back by an omnibus-pole. His sight was also affected, magnificent
displays of fireworks taking place between him and his morning paper
whenever he attempted to look at the leader. I saw at a glance that
there was congestion in the case, and at once ordered a massage bath of
hot potted shrimps. This was followed at first by the exhibition of some
feverish symptoms, but, by a persistent recourse to it uninterruptedly
for six consecutive months, they gradually disappeared, and I consider
him now in a much improved condition. It is true that his faculties
appear to have left him, and that he addresses me as "King of the
Coloboo Islands," and, whenever he gets a chance, puts things on the sly
across the railway lines to upset the trains, and eats his newspaper;
but I fancy the noises in his head have disappeared. I have lately sent
him out in charge of the Retired Smuggler, who assures me that, beyond
bonneting a middle-aged lady on a donkey with the shrimping-net,
beginning a war-dance in a neighbouring public-house, and pushing a
shortsighted naturalist who was collecting zoophytes at the end of the
pier into the water, there has been nothing at all to distinguish his
behaviour from that of any ordinary nobleman making a short stay at the
sea-side. I have him now watched, for I think it as well, by six
attendants night and day, but I consider him quite my showcase. The more
I look at him the more it is brought home to me what wonders the shrimps
have done for him.</p>

<p>I could, of course, continue my extracts, but my space is limited, and I
must stop here. I think, however, I have revealed enough of the new
treatment to induce any waverer to no longer hesitate, but to get it at
once, and put himself or herself unreservedly under the careful charge
of your highly scientific and circumspect correspondent,

a precious bad one Poor <span class="smcap">Polyglot</span> had for making a show of

During the twelve months reign of <span class="smcap">Polyglot</span> it is probable that

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
